Chapter 2: Getting Started, Short Answer Questions (1, 3, 10-12) -

1.) Why would it be a bad idea to enter the following Bash commands?

    cd
    rm -r *

    Answer: The Bash commands above starts by specifying the home directory (cd) and will 
            delete (rm) all (*) files and then deletes all directories (-r).

3.) What is the difference between compiling and linking?
    
    Answer: Compiling within the Bash command line will translate the source code into 
            object code containing machine code. Linking within the Bash command will
            then take multiple object files and combine them into an executable file to
            run the program.

10.) What is wrong with the following code, and how would you fix it?

     int sum;
     for(int i=0; i<1000; ++i) {
         sum += i;
     }
     
     printf("Sum of 0 to 999 is %d\n" , sum);

     Answer: The variable "sum" is never initialized and could result in unpredictable
     values at execution.

11.) What is wrong with the following code, and how would you fix it?

     int n = 1;
     if(n=0) {
         printf("n is zero\n");
     }

     Answer: In the if statement the operator "=" is an assignment not a boolean 
     comparison so it will set the value of n to zero causing the program to print the 
     line stating n is zero even though the intention is to have n equal to 1.

12.) What would happen if you ran the following code and why?

     for(int i=0; i<10; ++i){
         if(i=0) break;
     }

     Answer: In the if statement the index value is assigned to zero which in C++ is 
     false so the break statement will not execute. On the first pass this is not an 
     issue, but after the index increments to 1 & the if statement gets re-evauluated
     it reassigns the index back to 0 because the "=" is an assignment operator 
     causing the break statement to never execute resulting in an infinite loop.
